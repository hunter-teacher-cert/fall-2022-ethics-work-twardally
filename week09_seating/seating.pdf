When an economy ticket is purchased then the airline may allow you to select seats for an additional cost. They may have a pop-up telling you the price of your selected seat(s). Instead of a pop-up with the seat price they should have a pop-up asking the traveler if they are traveling with a minor, significant other or spouse. If yes then allow for the selection of seats free of charge. If no then continue with no seat selection or pay the given price. 
I believe this is very practical to implement because they already have the pop-up telling you the price and to confirm or to continue without purchase.
