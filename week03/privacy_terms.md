What was striking to me was that both communication platforms had very low scores for Ads & Tracking: Prohibiting the exploitation of users' decision making process. Snapchat scored 50% and WhatsApp scored 36%.  They were both low within the concern of Data Security: Protecting against unauthorized access. Snapchat scored 0% and WhatsApp scored 33%.
