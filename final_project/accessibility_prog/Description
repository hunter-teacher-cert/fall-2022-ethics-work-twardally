What is Web Accessibility and Why is it important?
Web accessibility is ensuring people with disabilities can use the world wide web and internet. They both range from anything and everything people use and see. Our program is based off of a communication between two students similar to a knock knock joke. The teacher is prompting the boy to communicate with the girl and take her shopping if she wants to go.  Program 1 is based on the general use of a software that would require the user to input data using the keyboard and mouse. However we have created the speech to text version for someone that may have a fine motor skills disability. We considered the person that may have developed this disorder over time with a repetitive strain injury.  We had to consider the users inability to use the mouse or keyboard and allowed for voice recognition to prompt next inputs.  The teacher is prompting the boy to communicate but the boy and speak his name and questions to the teacher and girl. The girl will respond to the boy's voice inputs.
